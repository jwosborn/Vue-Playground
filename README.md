## Vue-Playground is a playground for Jeremy Osborn to code along with Laracasts as well as to experiment with the language. It was created using the boilerplate Vue.js in the CLI. 


### It will likely take many shapes over time as I experiment with different data flows and functions within Vue.js as I prepare to build a blog site using the framework.
